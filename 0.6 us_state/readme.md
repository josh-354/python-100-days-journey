🗺️ U.S. States Game — Python Turtle Project
A fun and educational Python project built using turtle and pandas that tests your knowledge of the 50 U.S. states!


🎮 Game Description
When you run this game, a blank map of the United States appears. Your goal is to guess all 50 U.S. states. Each correct guess will display the state’s name in its correct location on the map.

If you want to stop playing, simply type Exit, and the game will save the remaining states you didn't guess into a states_to_learn.csv file so you can study them later!
