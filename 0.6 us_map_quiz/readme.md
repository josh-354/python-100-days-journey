### 🎯 What is this?
A fun, interactive game built with **Python**, **Turtle graphics**, and **Pandas** that challenges you to guess all **50 U.S. states**!  
For each correct guess, the state name appears on a blank map of the U.S. If you give up, the game will show you which states you missed so you can study them later.
